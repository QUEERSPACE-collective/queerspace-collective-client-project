when admin enters user email:
    [ ] Registers user email (username), userType, and
        temp password into db
    [ ] Sends email to user email with username, temp pw,
        and link to sign in (domain/login/${temp pw})??
User must sign in w/in 24hrs or pw doesn't work
Must also change password after first signing in
